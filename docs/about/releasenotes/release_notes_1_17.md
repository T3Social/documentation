## January 2025

### Connect Content Across Your Network with Global Topics

With this version, we are introducing _**Global Topics**_, making it easier than ever to organize and discover content across your entire network. Previously, each Space had its own set of topics, but now network-wide topics are available, allowing for unified tagging across Spaces. This feature simplifies content discovery, connecting users with relevant discussions and resources more efficiently. If you are a long-time user of HumHub, don't worry, of course we have thought of you too. Administrators can easily **convert existing Space-specific topics to Global Topics** through the admin menu, ensuring a cohesive and searchable network experience for all members.

### Resending Invitation in Bulk

This new version also makes it easy to reconnect with users who have not yet registered by allowing you to resend invitations in bulk. Instead of sending reminders individually, administrators can now select multiple pending invitations and resend them all at once. This feature saves time and helps bring more users on board faster, making it simple to grow and engage your community.

### Easier Access to Notification Settings

Users can now access their notification settings directly from the main navigation. This update makes it simpler for users to adjust their preferences quickly, whether they want to receive more updates or reduce notifications. With easier access, users have more control over how they stay informed and engaged with their community.
